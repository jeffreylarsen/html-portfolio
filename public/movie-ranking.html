<h1>The Best Movies!</h1> 
<h2>According to Jeffrey</h2>

<h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>This movie sparked my eye for visual artestry.</p>

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>I feel like a guy who is cooped up, and it's fun to see him break out of the routines of life.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Although this is a childrens film, the imagination, art and music move me. (I think it did scare me as a kid.)</p>
